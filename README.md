# Movies-ETL
This analysis was built around the ETL process, taking two different data sets, transforming them, merging them, and then loading them into SQL with Python. At the time of this writing, one error remains, and I lacked time to track it down and correct it; much of the ratings table did not make it into the SQL table.  I will go back and correct this in the future.
